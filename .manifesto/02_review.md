# 02_review.md — Instruction System Review

## Context Required

Before starting, ensure the following files are available in this session:
- `MANIFEST.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `protocols/_README.md`
- all canonical protocol files under `protocols/` required by this framework version
- `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`
- the project's full instruction system: root contract, skills, pipelines, agents, rules, and docs

If `.ai/docs/project_specification.md` is missing, stop and require `00_project_profile.md` first.

If anything else required for review is missing, stop and ask for it.

---

## Purpose

Audit the current instruction system against `MANIFEST.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

Use `.ai/docs/project_specification.md` as the authoritative profile source for user role, recurring duties, capability triggers, AI tools, quality expectations, and local authority sources.

This is a skeptical review.
Assume the system is wrong until proven correct.

Do not implement fixes before the audit and clarification phases are complete.

---

## Working Mode

Work in exactly 4 phases:
1. Audit
2. Clarification
3. Final Validation
4. Implementation and Verification, only when the user requests it

During Clarification, follow `protocols/brainstorm.md`.
Do not modify files during Phases 1-3.

---

## Phase 1 — Audit

### 0. Root Contract Presence

Determine which root contract model applies.

Compare the detected model against `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`.

For single-tool projects:
- verify that the tool's official native entrypoint exists and acts as the full operational contract
- verify the native entrypoint against the tool's current official docs when needed
- verify that supporting artifacts follow the selected tool's native structure

For multi-tool or AI-agnostic projects:
- verify that `AGENTS.md` exists and acts as the root operational contract
- verify that supported tool-specific entry files are thin adapters to `AGENTS.md`
- verify that shared skills use the framework-standard format `.ai/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`
- verify that each shared skill uses Claude-style YAML frontmatter with at least `name` and `description`
- verify that shared project rules, when present, live in the project rules layer

In both cases:
- verify that routing and capability declarations are visible from the root contract
- verify that execution details are delegated to skills, pipelines, and agents

### Context And Simplicity

#### 1. Load Only What You Need

- is the root contract minimal
- are skills, pipelines, agents, rules, and docs on-demand only
- are tool adapters lightweight

#### 2. Build For Now, Not For Later

- does each artifact satisfy a current profile, repository, or workflow trigger
- are speculative abstractions avoided
- are new capabilities justified by repeated or high-risk work

#### 3. Escalate Only When Justified

- does the system start from direct execution and escalate only when needed
- are pipelines and agents justified by concrete profile or repository triggers

### Authority And Structure

#### 4. Give Every Artifact One Job

- does each file have one responsibility
- do execution skills contain orchestration logic
- do pipelines stay purely orchestration
- does the manager-equivalent stay purely routing and orchestration
- do shared rules contain standards rather than task procedures

#### 5. Separate Policy From Execution

- does the root contract contain policy rather than execution logic
- are procedures confined to skills and pipelines
- do tool-specific files duplicate project policy

#### 6. Keep One Source Of Truth

Check for duplicated rules across:
- root contract and skills
- skills and pipelines
- multiple skills
- skills or agents and shared rules
- docs and skills

#### 7. Respect Existing Authority

- are existing capabilities audited before new ones are proposed
- are project-native names preserved when they already satisfy the framework
- are near-duplicate authorities flagged for user decision

### Control And Safety

#### 8. Make Behavior Explicit

- are assumptions, success criteria, and stopping conditions visible
- are uncertainties surfaced before action
- are validation expectations stated before implementation

#### 9. Gates Must Actually Gate

Check the main routing gate in the root contract:
- is the language imperative
- is the next concrete capability named
- does the gate appear before capability registry
- is trivial classification explicit
- are validation and completion gates mandatory where required

Descriptive routing remains a critical violation.

#### 10. Ask Before You Cut

- are risky changes blocked until explicit user consent exists
- does the review name the risk and intended safe outcome
- are rename, delete, merge, and authority changes treated as consent-required

### Protocol Inventory and Applicability

- read every canonical protocol under `protocols/`, excluding `protocols/_README.md`
- treat protocol frontmatter as authoritative
- determine which protocol triggers are present
- derive required capabilities from `implementation` and `requires_when`

### Protocol Coverage

For each required protocol, verify:
- a corresponding project capability exists
- the capability is standalone and project-local
- it implements the protocol's mandatory rules
- it includes any needed project-specific adaptation without contradiction

Flag as a major violation if a project skill depends on framework protocol files or framework paths at runtime.

### Project Rules

For each shared project rule, verify:
- at least two skills or agents reference it or clearly need it
- it defines shared best-practice standards rather than one task procedure
- referencing skills or agents do not copy the same statements locally
- it does not duplicate facts that belong in reference docs

Flag as a violation if a rule exists for one skill only.

### Imported Capability Adoption

When the project adopted an external framework, starter kit, or reusable capability bundle, verify:
- whether demo residue remains, such as sample pages, sample tests, placeholder fixtures, or example docs that are not justified by the host repository
- whether the imported capability was normalized into the host project's routing model instead of bringing its own competing orchestration
- whether imported skills, pipelines, agents, or registries conflict with the host root contract or duplicate existing project capabilities
- whether the adopted code still compiles or typechecks in the host repository after import
- whether exported files have the required imports and no obvious unresolved references remain
- which concrete validation commands would prove the adoption is intact, even if those commands cannot be run during the review

### Structure and Refactor Risks

Check for:
- near-duplicate capabilities
- monolithic pipeline registries
- mixed AI roots
- stale unsupported tool entrypoints
- oversized files that likely violate single responsibility
- imported orchestration layers that bypass or weaken the project's canonical routing path
- project rules that create competing authority

### 12. Validation and Completion

- does every non-trivial pipeline include explicit validation
- is `task-complete` enforced for non-trivial work
- are stronger review loops reserved for higher-risk work

## Phase 1 Output

Provide:

### Root Contract Report

| Location | Mode | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| ... | Single-tool / Multi-tool | Valid / Ambiguous / Missing | ... |

### Protocol Coverage Report

| Protocol | Required for This Project | Expected Capability | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------|-------|
| ... | Yes / No | ... | Valid / Missing / Ambiguous / Overbuilt | ... |

### Violations

List findings by severity with file references.
Prioritize:
- critical routing failures
- incorrect root contract model
- duplicated or blurred responsibilities
- protocol coverage failures
- imported-framework adoption failures such as demo residue, broken compilation, or competing orchestration

Then list:
- open ambiguities that require clarification
- residual risks or testing gaps

---

## Phase 2 — Clarification

If genuine ambiguity remains, ask only the minimum questions needed to complete the audit.

Follow `protocols/brainstorm.md` exactly:
- one question at a time
- 2-3 options
- explicit trade-offs
- stop and wait

Do not mix clarification with fixes.

---

## Phase 3 — Final Validation

Produce:
- final verdict: compliant, partially compliant, or non-compliant
- the minimum fix plan required for compliance
- which issues are risky changes that require user approval

Do not implement until the user explicitly asks.

---

## Phase 4 — Implementation and Verification

Only after user request:
- apply the approved fixes
- verify the resulting system
- report what changed and what remains
